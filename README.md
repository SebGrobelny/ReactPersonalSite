Personal Website in Node.js and React

Welcome to my personal site which runs on Node.js server code thanks to the express library in javascript. The server side code is present in server.js while the react code is present in the static directory and utilizes main.js along with Counter.js for the clock present in the homepage. All of the bootstrap style sheets are located in sub directories of static directory as well.
